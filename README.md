# Chingu Solo Project - Tier 1 - Tickybot Clone

[TickyBot Clone](https://itzmidinesh.github.io/)

## Overview
This is my attempt at cloning the [TickyBot Page](https://maknetaro.github.io/tickyBot/) using **HTML/CSS** and **JavaScript**. This is to submit for the solo project at [chingu.io](https://chingu.io)

### Cloning A Website

Cloning means to create a web page with a layout as identical as possible to 
the template. Fonts, colors, and images are not important. The layout of the 
web page on the other hand should be the same. A suggestion would be to 
compare the way the template looks face to face to the clone.

And no, you don't have to re-create the TickyBot animation if you don't 
feel ready :) If you want, use this opportunity to get creative and come up 
with something of your own for that space.
